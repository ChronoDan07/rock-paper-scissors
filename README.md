# rock-paper-scissors
This is an early version of a Rock, Paper and Scissors game coded with JavaScript and implemented in a webpage.
The game displays the player's and computer's scores, the rounds played and the outcome of the first of the two (player/computer) to reach 5 won rounds.
It also has a reset feature to restore the game to the start position.
Modified the UI, it is working without any bugs unlike the previous one, added some
transition and some sounds to it, also fixed the flexing of the page.
